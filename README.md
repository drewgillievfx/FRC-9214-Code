# FRC-9214-Code
2023 Robotics Team 9214

# Robotics Code Repository
This repository contains code related to robotics.  It includes the code
needed to deploy onto the robot as well as practice code for learning
purposes.

## Small Note:
This repo will not be like typical repos as this will be a teaching
method for python and github version control software for the students

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you'll need to have a basic
understanding of programming and robotics. You'll also need to have a
compatible development environment set up on your computer.

# Installs
This code will be written in python.
To make sure you have the latest version 3.11.1 you can run this line in your
terminal:
### mac
brew install python
### pc
winget install python

# Accessing the code
**1.** We will be using git-hub for this project and will need the desktop
application 'GitHub Desktop' which can be found here:
https://desktop.github.com/

**2.** Using a text editor like Visual Studio Code is advised.
That can be found here:

### Code style:
This code will adhere to the PEP 8 styleguide.  Try to keep as close to it as
possible.  https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
To enable this in VS Code, go to **View/Command Palette**
select **Python Select Linter** then click **pycodestyle**
This will show code style errors.

### For the time being:
Main: This branch will be the current working version of the code
Test: This branch will be used for testing new code
Archive: This holds the code as of Feb 18th 2023 and any outside code
Student: This branch will be for student testing.

Students: if you feel more comfortable, make a new branch off the
**Student** branch and label the branch with your name.
