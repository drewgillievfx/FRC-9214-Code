Exercise # 2

Excellent!  Everything is working properly.  Let's get a little more tricky.

We want to create some simple variables, and put those variables inside of
a print statement.  This is called an 'F-print' in python3.

To create a variable we just have to name it, and set it equal to some value
x = 10
y = 18.7
name = Squishy

so the {x} is an integer that equals 10

The {y} is a float that equals 18.7
    a float is just a number with a decimal point value

And the {name} is set to the word Squishy, however this is incorrect syntax
    anytime you have a word in code, this is called a string
    a string of characters is defined by quotes. 
    for right now, it does not matter if it is '' or ""
    so...
        name = "Squishy"
        or
        name = 'Squishy'

It should read: 
    Drew is a mentor for the team
    I am a student, and my name is INSERT_NAME_HERE
