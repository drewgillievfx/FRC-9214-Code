Exercise # 1

Everything in between the triple quote is called a comment block and is not
executed when the code is run.

This way I can write instructions for you to practice coding.  If you already
know how to code, that is great!  This is to help guide you along the way to
make it not scary or intimidating for those without coding experience.  I
would recommend everyone work through these exercises though.

------------------------------------------------------
Your first task is to run this code through a terminal
------------------------------------------------------

1. First, open up a terminal window.
** mac : [cmd+space] [type 'terminal'] [open terminal]
** win : [windows key] [type 'cmd'] [open command prompt]

2. You will need to navigate to the folder where this code is located.
This is called changing directories  - OR - Change Directory
to do this you will typ 'cd' (without the quote) add a space, then
add the folder path

in the terminal you should see something like:
cd /folder_path

It might look like this, except where it says 'computerName' that will be
unique to your own computer
cd /Users/computerName/Documents/GitHub/FRC-9214-Code

Press enter to actually change directories.

Your terminal is now ready to run whatever code you have located inside of
this folder!  

3. So now we want to run this code.  Here is how we do that:

We are running a python script, so we need to call the language and then
call the script we want to run.  This will look like the line below in the
terminal:
python3 exercise_1.py

Your computer will run the script. This script will simply print out a line of
characters to the terminal.

It should read: 
    Hello Team 9214
    Python Exercise #1 Complete!

When this is executed properly, you can move to the next exercise!
